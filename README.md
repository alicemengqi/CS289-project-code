##LogisticModel-cvxpylayer-prescriptive-SGD.ipynb:

This file is the main file to generate synthetic dataset, implement our proposed method and all other benchmarks except the end-to-end learning method using CVXpy layer. This notebook is written in julia and some part of if use pycall.jl to call a subroutine written in python. More details can be found in the notebook. The result at the end of the notebook can be generated by run this notebook multiple times. This notebook dumps several CSV datasets which serves as input of Logistic-Diff-convex-opt-layer.ipynb.

##Logistic-Diff-convex-opt-layer.ipynb:

In this file I implemented the end-to-end learning method using neural network with an differentiable convex optimization layer attached. Please see my report and the references provided in the report for the details of this method. To run this file, you need to first run some parts in LogisticModel-cvxpylayer-prescriptive-SGD.ipynb to generate datasets.
